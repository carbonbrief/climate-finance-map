In response, the Government has proposed a project that aims to improve the adaptive capacity of the Southern zone in the face of anticipated climate-induced reduction in food production through eg water saving irrigation and other adaptation techniques; and build institutional capacity at the national, regional, and local levels to better understand climate trends and impacts."
